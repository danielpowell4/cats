# CATS

This app is a barebones scaffold of an app. It was made as part of [The Firehose Project](http://www.thefirehoseproject.com/)

The most important piece of this app was the single PR that added a few columns
to the cat table. It also added them to the private method cat_params on the controller and in the appropriate forms and views.
This was important as cats' personality is dependent on their color and age--not just their name.

**You can find the PR [here](https://github.com/danielpowell4/cats/pull/1).** It has since been closed.
